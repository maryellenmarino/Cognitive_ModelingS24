    "Construct a small story of your own choosing in the spirit of the “Murder Mystery” we considered in class (can be from a completely different domain). Define a “prior” distribution, a “likelihood”, and justify your selection of probabilities. Create a first folder in your team repository and write a script containing fully vectorized code which simulates your story and outputs a table representing the approximate joint probabilities (which we approximated through the relative frequencies across N simulation runs). Compare this table to the analytic probabilities. How large should N be for the approximate probabilities to become almost indistinguishable from the analytic ones?"

    "In a distant future, where interstellar travel is commonplace, a notorious heist has taken place in the Galactic Museum. Two suspects, a notorious Space Pirate and a cunning Galactic Spy, are believed to be involved in stealing one of three precious artifacts: the Quantum Crystal, the Hyperdrive Core, or the Alien Relic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characters:\n",
    "- **Space Pirate**: Known for audacious space heists.\n",
    "- **Galactic Spy**: Skilled in stealth and infiltration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Items:\n",
    "- **Quantum Crystal**: A rare gem with unique properties.\n",
    "- **Hyperdrive Core**: Essential for faster-than-light travel.\n",
    "- **Alien Relic**: An ancient artifact of unknown origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "We will construct a probabilistic model to simulate this scenario. Our model will incorporate prior probabilities reflecting the likelihood of each suspect's involvement and the conditional probabilities (likelihoods) of each suspect choosing a specific item. By simulating this scenario multiple times, we'll estimate the joint probabilities of each suspect-item combination and compare these with the analytically calculated probabilities."
